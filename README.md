# AndriyTest

This is my tech test for mid level Android developer role.

Main idea of the task to test code structure and use of build in functionality.

Test was completed successfully. 
During interview was informed this is first completed and functioning test. 

I did not select this company as possible employment because unclear workflow 
and some processes is questionable.
